                        <p>I grew up in Laguna Niguel, California, a beautiful suburban municipality in south Orange County located less
                            than three miles from the Pacific Ocean. Needless to say, I have a few gnarly beach recommendations for those
                            visiting the Dana Point area. I went to Dana Hills High School and took my talents to Los Angeles to pursue an
                            engineering degree at the University of Southern California. Contrary to popular opinion on engineers, there is
                            a lot more to this future leader and innovator in sports analytics.
                        </p>

                        </div> -->
                        <p>My parents put me in Little League baseball when I was six years old. I began developing my talents as the
                            scrawny southpaw, a terrifying player to any pitcher under twelve years old. In fact, there was one season that
                            I got hit by a pitch every single game and garnered a rather appropriate nickname, The Magnet. While I
                            continued playing first base and hitting somewhere between seventh and thirteenth in the lineup, I began
                            collecting baseball cards. Over the years, I had accrued more than two full binders of cards based on league and
                            organized by team and last name. This library of past and present baseball sparked my obsession with the sport.
                            Throughout middle school, I would watch MLB Network's recap show <em>Hot Stove</em> every morning and all-time
                            ranking show <em>Prime 9</em> in the afternoon. My baseball trivia knowledge was growing, for I was addicted to
                            the sport.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 2008, I embarked on a journey that challenged me both mentally and physically: running the Los Angeles
                            Marathon. As a sixth-grade student at the time, I would train after school and on weekends to prepare for the
                            daunting 26.2 miles. After putting in over 800 miles in eight months, I completed the LA Marathon on May 25,
                            2009. I apparently had such a fun time doing it that I trained and completed it again in 2010, the first year of
                            the "Stadium to the Sea" route.
                        </p>
                        <p>I realized that being a high school first baseman was not my calling, so I tried out for the Dana Hills cross
                            country team. I had to convert my marathon endurance to finishing three miles in under twenty minutes just to be
                            on the team. After daily training over the summer, I made the team and continued to improve as a cross-country
                            runner. I finally hit a personal best 17:09 for three miles as a sophomore and graduated with the third-best
                            team in the nation.
                        </p>
                        <p>When I arrived as a freshman at USC in August 2015, I did not have a strong idea of what I wanted to do. I knew I was
                            going to be an engineer, but I also did not want to work with cars and rockets and other things that most other
                            mechanical engineers are attracted to. It wasn't until my first gameday when I understood my true passion: sports.
                            The atmosphere of my first USC gameday was truly surreal with the authentic pride, talent and excitement that
                            surrounded the sport. I became obsessed with college football and realized I could convert this passion into a
                            product. I have since completed a minor in sports media studies (while taking some business classes), worked in
                            several sports jobs, and created my own college football quarterback statistic. What I learned along the way is that
                            rather than be a cookie-cutter engineer, I can combine some of my talents and passions to create something new. In
                            other words, I get more fulfillment in bridging the relationship between numbers and culture.
